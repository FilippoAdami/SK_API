To use the APIs clone the repository and add the secrets.json file in the root folder.
Run the command "dotnet restore" in a new terminal inside the root folder to ensure that all the required packages are installed.
Finally run the Program.cs file; a Swagger local web-page will open, there you can try the APIs.
